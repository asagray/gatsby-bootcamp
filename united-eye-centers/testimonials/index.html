		  <p class="subhead">Many of our patients write us to express their satisfaction with United Eye Centers. These are just an example of the letters we receive each year. </p>
		  <p>Dear Dr. Conahan, </p>
		  <p>I just wanted to take the time to say &ldquo;thanks&rdquo; for fixing my vision! Since having the LASIK correction of my vision, my life has changed. I imagined what it would be like without glasses but didn&rsquo;t even realize myself just how freeing this is. </p>
		  <p><strong>You and your staff were very professional and managed to put me at ease</strong> with the procedure, even though I tend to be quite a &ldquo;wimp&rdquo; when it comes to anything with my eyes.<strong> I felt completely prepared for the procedure and the recovery period</strong>, which was pleasingly uneventful. The entire process was surprisingly painless. </p>
		  <p><strong>My only regret is that I didn&rsquo;t do this sooner</strong>. Thanks again for improving the quality of my life and for being my eye physician.</p>

		  <p>Dear Dr. Conahan,</p>
		  <p>I just wanted to thank you again for providing me with such an excellent LASIK experience. I simply couldn&rsquo;t be happier with the results!</p>
		  <p><strong>You turned a procedure which I was initially very apprehensive about into an enjoyable experience. I also wanted to compliment you on the way you treat your patients. </strong>I really appreciated the fact that I never had to wait more than 5 minutes to see you for my scheduled appointments. (Finally, a physician who respects my time as much as his own!)</p>
		  <p>As you know, I had lots of questions during our appointments, and I appreciate that you took your time in addressing them. <strong>Never was I made to feel rushed or that I was taking too much of your time.</strong></p>
		  <p>Again, thank you for the excellent care.</p>

		  <p>Dear Dr. Conahan, </p>
		  <p>I just finished my two-year exam with you on my &ldquo;PRKed&rdquo; eyes, and it reminded me that I never did take the time to properly thank you. Of course, it is great that my vision has remained at the benchmark 20/20, but <strong>my memory of the entire process &ndash; from the initial consultation to the final release &ndash; is one of exceptional care and genuine, selfless service.</strong></p>
		  <p>My doctor/patient relationship with you was the finest I can recall in my adult life. I can hardly remember wearing glasses and contacts (as I did since I was 11 years old) &ndash; which is truly amazing in and of itself &ndash; but<strong> the quality of care I received from you and your staff was the highlight of the entire process.</strong></p>
		  <p><strong><span class="ital">5280 Magazine&rsquo;s</span> accolades certainly hit the mark!</strong></p>
		  <p class="ital"> -- GC<br />
