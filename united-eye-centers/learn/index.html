			  <p>Learn about IntraLase &amp; iLASIK</p>
			</div>
			<p>Since LASIK was first approved in 1999, it has been regarded
			  as a safe and successful method of vision correction. Even so,
			  you&rsquo;re
			  not alone if you feel hesitant to move forward with surgery, wondering
			  what future advancements may hold. Dr. Conahan and United Eye Centers
			  now offers LASIK surgery using the IntraLase Method&trade;&mdash;also known
			  as all-laser LASIK or IntraLASIK&trade;&mdash;and it could be the very advancement
			  you&rsquo;ve
		  been waiting for.</p>
			<p class="subhead">How does the IntraLase Method improve the LASIK procedure? </p>
			<p>The IntraLase Method is a 100% blade-free approach to creating a corneal
			  flap, the thin layer of tissue the surgeon folds back to expose
			  the part of the eye that is reshaped during the LASIK procedure. With the
			  IntraLase Method, LASIK is not only 100% blade-free, but shown in clinical
			  studies to provide more patients with vision that is 20/20 or better.</p>
			<p>Prior to the IntraLase Method, doctors created corneal flaps with an instrument
			  called a microkeratome, which is a fine, oscillating, hand-held steel blade.
			  Although LASIK complications are extremely rare, when they do happen the
			  microkeratome is commonly the cause. </p>
			<p>The IntraLase Method, by contrast, eliminates the need for Dr. Conahan
			  to use a blade at all. Instead, the computer-guided IntraLase&reg; laser
			  delivers rapid pulses of light, a quadrillionth of a second each,
			  to a pre-programmed depth and position within your cornea. Each
			  pulse forms a microscopic bubble.&nbsp; As
			  the IntraLase laser moves back and forth across your eye, the bubbles
			  connect to form a corneal flap. Just prior to LASIK surgery, the
			  doctor gently lifts the flap where these bubbles have created a
			  smooth surface.</p>
			<p class="subhead">Why IntraLase? </p>
			<p>LASIK surgery has advanced steadily over the years; the technology used
			  to measure your visual error prior to surgery has become more powerful and
			  corrections can be optimized to your needs.&nbsp; Until the IntraLase Method,
			  however, the creation of the corneal flap was the one step that lacked the
			  technological sophistication of the rest of the LASIK procedure. As it turns
			  out, that step is an important one in terms of providing you with the best
			  possible LASIK experience.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>In addition, if you were not eligible for LASIK surgery performed
			with a microkeratome due to steep, flat, or thin corneas, you may now be a
			candidate with the IntraLase Method. In fact, IntraLase training has become
			part of the curriculum at most of the ophthalmic teaching institutions and
			is rapidly being adopted by eye care practices around the world.</p>
			<p class="subhead">What is iLASIK?</p>
			<p><img src="../images/ilasik_logo.gif" width="180" height="80" class="floatimg" />Millions of  patients who were previously denied as candidates for  LASIK treatment have been waiting for the most advanced LASIK technology. They've been waiting for the iLASIK procedure.</p>
			<p>iLASIK  combines the power of of IntraLase technology with the Advanced CustomVue treatment using VISX technology. iLASIK offers doctors unprecedented control and accuracy during the procedure, so patients with thin corneas and other factors that prevented them from receiving LASIK treatment in the past can now be reconsidered for the procedure.</p>
			<p>The most compelling solution &mdash; the most impressive surgical technology &mdash; is the one that performs exceptionally in demanding situations. The iLASIK technology platform continues to pass every test. Need proof? NASA recently approved iLASIK for use on U.S. astronauts. This milestone comes on the heels of a similar approval for all branches of the U.S. military personnel.</p>
