			  <p>Learn about NearVision CK </p>
			</div>
			<p class="subhead">What is NearVision CK?</p>
			<p>NearVision CK is an exciting advancement in vision correction. It corrects vision for patients over 40 years of age who have had wonderful vision for their entire lives, but now struggle with their near vision and wish to be able to read without the assistance of reading glasses. No laser is used in this procedure, but rather a controlled release of radiofrequency (RF) energy, so there is no cutting involved and recovery time is faster.</p>
			<blockquote>
			  <p><strong>Step 1</strong> Numbing eye drops are applied to the eye.</p>
			  <p><strong>Step 2</strong> The treatment pattern is imprinted on the eye with a rinse-away dye.</p>
			  <p><strong>Step 3</strong> A hair-thin instrument is used to apply the RF energy to the cornea, tightening around it like a belt and improving near vision.</p>
		  </blockquote>
			<p class="subhead">Is NearVision CK for me?</p>
			<p>If you are over 40 years of age and have had wonderful distance vision without glasses or contacts for most of your life, and if you are tired of your reading glasses, NearVision CK is for you! You may not be a good candidate for NearVision CK if you have any chronic eye disorders, if you are pregnant or nursing, or if you have a chronic illness or disease. If any of these conditions apply to you, a consultation with Dr. Conahan will reveal your best treatment plan.</p>
			<p class="subhead">What vision problems can NearVision CK correct?</p>
			<p>NearVision CK corrects the vision problem of being unable to focus on near objects, such as a menu or newspaper, due to farsightedness or presbyopia.</p>
			<p class="subhead">What can I expect the day of my NearVision CK procedure?</p>
			<p>The day of your procedure, Dr. Conahan will ask you to refrain from wearing makeup and to arrange a ride for yourself both to and from the surgery center. The procedure itself will be completed in just a few minutes.</p>
			<p class="subhead">How soon can I resume my daily activities after NearVision CK?</p>
			<p>After the procedure, you may experience some light sensitivity or eye discomfort for a few days, but Dr. Conahan will recommend some eye drops to help alleviate discomfort. Virtually all activities should be able to be resumed the next day.</p>
			<p class="subhead">What are the results of NearVision CK?</p>
			<p>In a clinical study for NearVision CK, 9 out of 10 patients could see 20/20 or better in the distance and could read newspaper-sized print without glasses after receiving the NearVision CK procedure.</p>
		  <p class="subhead">How much does NearVision CK cost and what does the price include?</p>
			<p>NearVision CK costs $1,500 per eye. This pricing includes all pre-procedure evaluations and testings, the procedure itself, and all visits needed for one year post-op, and an enhancement, if needed, within one year of the initial procedure. If an upgrade is performed after the one-year mark from the original procedure, the fee is half of the current fee charged for the procedure.<br />

	  	<p>&quot;Wow! I can see a menu now without reading glasses! It&rsquo;s so great to look down and see what&rsquo;s written in front of me like I did 10 years ago. Thank you for exceeding my expectations with NearVision CK. This is so great!&quot;</p>
	  	<p class="ital">-- SC </p>
	  	<p>&quot;I had worn glasses for many years. In the fall of 2004 I received a letter from Dr. Conahan saying that I could be a candidate for NearVision CK. </p>
	  	<p>&quot;I decided to have the surgery, and I am very pleased with the results. I can swim, drive, read, and shop just like when I was in my thirties. For me, it has been an experience that I am glad I did not miss. Thank you, Dr. Conahan, and your marvelous staff!&quot;</p>
