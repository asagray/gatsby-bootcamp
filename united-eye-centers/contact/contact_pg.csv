My name is Larry Huber. I have experienced a gradual and now significant decomposition of my corneas as a result of RK procedures done in 1989. I understand that this long term and gradual decomposition is very typical for RK patients , resulting in  far sightedness. The RK procedures were done by Dr. Britt Buckley here in Colorado.      I am investigating CK as an alternative to a crystal lens implant to improve my eye sight.     Do you have experience and /or an informed judgment as to the effectiveness of CK for correction of corneal decomposition due to long term result of Radial Keratotomy?     I would very much appreciate your response.     Sincerely  Larry Huber|Submit

Erin Husk|eringhusk@hotmail.com|1531 Stout St. #301|Denver|CO|80202|303-947-8767|I have a complaint about your optical centers and I\'m not sure where else to register it.  I came in a couple of weeks ago to see Dr. Anderson at the Highlands Ranch office (who was great - I have no complaints about my experience with her).  She said my prescription had changed slightly and I had the option of getting new lenses if I wanted to, which I went ahead and did through the optical center - since that is where I originally got my glasses two years ago.  That\'s where the problems began.  First of all, no one called me to tell me my lenses were ready, I finally called them after about three weeks.  When I did finally get the new lenses, I told the guy who put them in for me that everything looked a little fuzzy.  He said I was probably getting used to the new prescription and I should call if it didn\'t get better after I wore them for a while.  Then he asked me if I wanted to keep the old lenses, and since I didn\'t know of a reason why I would, he threw them away.  I wore them over the weekend, and not only did it not get better, they were so distorted that it made me sick to wear them.  I called and went back in to see Dr. Anderson on Monday where I found out that the prescription was correct, but nobody had measured my pupils, so I wasn\'t looking through the center of the lenses (nowhere close to it, in fact) - which was what caused the distortion.  They took the measurement and I gave them my glasses (since they were useless to me).  I asked if I could pick them up at the Midtown office, since it was a lot closer and more convenient for me.  I was a little disappointed that it was going to take a week to remake my lenses, since that meant I would have to spend a week squinting at my computer screen at work, my TV at home and the road when I\'m driving.  Yesterday someone called me to tell me my glasses were ready, so today I took time away from work (which I don\'t get paid for) and made a trip over to the office at 2005 Franklin Street to pick them up.  When I got there, they didn\'t have them and when I told them they were supposed to be sent from the Highlands Ranch office, they said they must still be in Highlands Ranch and they would be there first thing in the morning.  I called Highlands Ranch later this afternoon just to make sure, and the person I talked to didn\'t seem to have any idea that they were supposed to be sent to the Midtown office.  So I suppose it\'s a good thing I called, or I would have wasted a second trip over there tomorrow.  She said they could mail them to me, but it could be up to 5 days before I got them.  When I asked if they could possibly rush them and explained the whole situation she told me no - they have these first class mailer \"things\" there, that\'s what they use to send things and they don\'t deal with Fed-Ex.  So, basically, my complaint is this.  Someone didn\'t take a basic measurement to make sure the lenses were right in the first place, no one called me to tell me they were ready, when I finally picked them up and said they seemed fuzzy, they didn\'t take a closer look at them to see if there was a problem and didn\'t advise me that I might want to keep the old lenses as a back up in case the new ones didn\'t work.  Then after the doctor figured out what was wrong with my lenses and they made new ones - they either forgot where I was supposed to pick them up or neglected to tell me that they were ready - but not at the place where I was supposed to get them.  Then, after complaining that this would be the third trip (costing me money both in missed work and bus fare/gas money) that I would have to make because someone there had screwed up, no one could do anything to make sure I got them in a timely fashion without me having to make that trip - leaving me the choice of either taking off from work again to get them, or waiting almost another week without my glasses.  If that was my business and I had an unhappy customer who had been inconvenienced on multiple occasions - I would have sent someone out to the post office, or to a UPS or Fed Ex location to send their glasses overnight.  I\'m sure I\'m not sending this to the people who should probably get it, but I just thought someone should hear it.  I may be back to see Dr. Anderson in a couple of years when it\'s time to check my eyes again, but I will never use the United Optical Centers again if I need new glasses, and I will tell anyone who asks me not to use them as well.|Submit

I am a very satisfied customer and have bragged about Dr. Conahan and my wonderful experience to all my family and friends. I am also a mom of four year-old twins at the Montessori Academy of Colorado (MAC) preschool in Denver and full-time professor of Biology at UC Denver attempting to help my children\'s preschool obtain donations to our annual fundraiser event on May 9th at the Wings Over the Rockies Air & Space Museum in Lowry.     I am hoping that you are in a generous mood and willing to donate to our annual fundraising live and silent auction on May 9th at the Wings Over the Rockies Museum in Lowry. Any donation would be appreciated - $100 off a LASIK procedure?, $200 off a LASIK procedure?     There are so many parents at our preschool that I have told to go to Dr. Conahan for LASIK surgery. In fact, I posted a blog on our preschool website telling everyone about my wonderful experience at the United Eye Center and Dr. Conahan. I asked that families donate their used prescription eyeglasses to the \'Mission of the Healing Eyes\' going to Cambodia and Mexico this year. As a result, I collected 35+ pairs of eyeglasses - 24 have been delivered by me already and the remaining 10+ pairs will be delivered at my next check-up.     A discount on a LASIK procedure to your clinic would solicit top dollar for our preschool and give your clinic excellent advertisement to a community of parents that appreciate excellence in medicine (I noted on the blog that Dr. Conahan is consistently voted top eye surgeon year after year) as well as many parents that wear corrective eyeglasses or lenses and have a need for corrective surgery.    If you are interested, I can mail or hand deliver an official donation letter and donation form/receipt. I ask that if you are interested that you please contact me at your earliest convenience via e-mail or phone. I know that your clinic is very busy and I would not want to bother you with a phone call at an inconvenient time. I hope to hear from you in the near future!    Thank you!

Thank you,    Marcia Nugent    •	Are eyeglasses or contact lenses covered under TRICARE?   •	Active duty service members are covered for eyeglasses at MTFs at no cost.

She has been treated with padaday, zylet Erthromycin ointment, and  nonperservative drops.  It took the doctors over a month to diagnose and now they want to perform a Surgery Superficial Keratectomy.  This seems pretty drastic and I am worried that this may not be the right thing.

You had mentioned on my exam last Wednesday 4/14/10 that there would be an improvment in my vision I wanted to know how much improvement I might expect. Will I still need my glasses? How long after surgery do I have to wait to wear makeup since I wont be able to rub my eyes? What day of the week do you schedule this kind of surgery?  The temple on my glasses broke this past weekend and if I am going to need a new prescription after the surgery I would want to proceed with it as soon as possible as I dont want to have to pay for new frames and lenses if I dont need to. Does your office contact the insurance company for approval? Can both eyes be done at the same time?  I think that is all the questions I have at this time.

I was given a higher power prescription for contact lenses and glasses and was told if the new script gives me headaches that I should call and the doctor would give me a script back down where I belong at -4.25.  I called and left a message over a week ago and no one has called me back and I have not received the new prescriptions in the mail.  I would like to go get new vision supplies but am currently hindered by the lack of response.  I see Dr. Habhab at the Midtown office.  Would someone please respond to me regarding my request.

barbara buster|bab248@msn.com|599 oakwood dr #6|castle rock|co|80104|303 660 8687|i apologize for missing my appointment yesterday at 9:50 at the castle rock office. i am on the special needs bus & had a substitute driver that didnt know the route. his wife went to the emergency room for lap band complications & i got a different driver & he didnt know the route either. This early in the school year, the routes are constantly changing so the paper route for driver to read is never correct. At my elementary school they had a breakfast appreciation for the buses & i received a card the kids had signed. I had no idea they could print & was so delighted. However all of that in the morning left me forgetting my eye exam appointment with Dr.Conahan in castle rock.

Cherie L Strickland|cheriestrickland@yahoo.com|2810 Milwaukee St.|Denver|CO|80205|720-363-6611|On 12/14/10 I had a routine eye exam, given by Dr. Habhab. I was charged a co-pay of $60, when it should have been $30. I logged onto the United Healthcare site the next day and saw that my co-pay should have been $30. I also called United Healthcare, who confirmed this, then called to let Heidi know I was overcharged. I offered to fax the information, but she insisted they are \"specialists\" and my co-pay was $60. I received my EOB, and the contract states that my eye exams have a $30 co-pay. I asked if I should bring the EOB in future, should my husband want an exam, and Heidi said it wouldn\'t make a difference, United Eye Centers still goes by what some printout they get says.  It is incorrect, but Heidi says we will STILL be overcharged, although it is known that our co-pay is in fact $30. Today I had to call your billing department in order to get my $30 refunded. Is there not any way you can get correct information from United Healthcare? I\'m going to let them know that you KNOW you\'ll be overcharging my husband if he gets an exam, and me, if I go back in 2 years for another exam.    Cherie Strickland|Submit

William Tobey|wtobey303@aol.com|6700 W. Dorado Dr. #47|Littleton|CO|80123|303-660-9645|I thought Dr. Conahan and others might find this news release interesting:    Omeros\' Ophthalmology Product OMS302 Achieves Co-Primary Endpoints in Phase 2b Clinical StudyBY PR Newswire  — 7:00 AM ET 03/23/2011    SEATTLE, March 23, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- Omeros Corporation (OMER) , a biopharmaceutical company committed to discovering, developing and commercializing products focused on inflammation, bleeding and disorders of the central nervous system, today reported positive data from a Phase 2b clinical trial evaluating OMS302 in patients undergoing cataract surgery. OMS302, added to standard irrigation solution used during ophthalmological procedures, is Omeros (OMER)\' proprietary PharmacoSurgery™ product in development to maintain intra-operative mydriasis (pupil dilation) and reduce postoperative pain and irritation resulting from cataract and other lens replacement surgery.    In this 221-patient Phase 2b clinical study, subjects treated with OMS302 demonstrated statistically significant (p<0.0001) and clinically meaningful maintenance of mydriasis throughout the cataract procedure. If mydriasis is not maintained throughout the procedure, the risk of injuring structures within the eye increases and the required operating time is often prolonged. Of equal clinical relevance, OMS302 also significantly decreased (p=0.0418) pain in the early postoperative period and reduced the frequency of complaints of moderate and severe pain (2.5 times more complaints in the vehicle-treated patients). The drug product was safe and well tolerated in this study.     \"These data are compelling and could represent a major advance for lens replacement procedures, including cataract surgery and refractive lens exchange. OMS302 has the ability to facilitate the ease of the procedure while improving patient outcomes and safety,\" stated Alan S. Crandall, M.D., director of glaucoma and cataract, senior vice chairman of ophthalmology and visual sciences at the Moran Eye Center, University of Utah, and the immediate past president of the American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery.    \"Maintenance of mydriasis is critical to performing lens exchange safely and proficiently. In addition to the significant mydriatic benefit of OMS302 seen in this study, the reduction in pain reported by OMS302-treated patients is clinically important,\" stated Mark I. Rosenblatt, M.D., Ph.D., associate professor of ophthalmology, Weill Cornell Medical College. \"Because OMS302 is administered through the irrigation solution currently used during lens exchange, the drug product fits readily into the workflow of the operating room and does not require a change in the surgeon\'s routine procedure.\"    \"We are pleased that OMS302 demonstrated statistically significant and clinically relevant benefits in this full-factorial Phase 2b study,\" said Gregory A. Demopulos, M.D., chairman and chief executive officer of Omeros (OMER). \"Each component of the drug product showed clear efficacy. Given the strength and consistency of these clinical data, we have begun preparations for a pivotal Phase 3 program.\"     About the Phase 2b Study of OMS302    This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled Phase 2b clinical trial included 221 patients. To achieve the trial\'s full-factorial design, patients were randomized into one of four parallel treatment groups. The first arm (n=55) received OMS302, the second arm (n=55) received only the mydriatic agent in OMS302 (OMS302-mydriatic), the third arm (n=54) received only the anti-inflammatory agent in OMS302 (OMS302-anti-inflammatory) and the fourth arm (n=57) received standard irrigation solution without drug. The co-primary endpoints of the study included maintenance of mydriasis (pupil dilation) and reduction of postoperative ocular pain. Patients in the OMS302 group demonstrated statistically significant maintenance of mydriasis over both the OMS302-anti-inflammatory (p<0.0001) and vehicle-treated (p<0.0001) groups. Similarly, the OMS302-treated group demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in pain compared with both the OMS302-mydriatic (p=0.0089) and vehicle-treated (p=0.0418) groups, demonstrating that each component of OMS302 contributed to the efficacy of the product. OMS302 was safe and well tolerated in this study. The complete Phase 2b data set will be presented and published at a later date.    About OMS302    OMS302 is Omeros (OMER)proprietary PharmacoSurgery™ product candidate being developed for use during ophthalmological procedures, including cataract and other lens replacement surgery. OMS302 is a proprietary combination of an anti-inflammatory active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and an API that causes pupil dilation (mydriasis), each with well-known safety and pharmacologic profiles. FDA-approved drugs containing each of these APIs have been used in ophthalmological clinical practice for more than 15 years, and both APIs are contained in generic, FDA-approved drugs.     About Ophthalmological Procedures (Cataract and Other Lens Replacement Surgery)    Approximately three million cataract operations are performed in the United States each year, and that number is expected to increase as the U.S. population ages. Cataract and other lens replacement procedures involve replacement of the original lens of the eye with an artificial intraocular lens. These operations are typically performed to replace a lens opacified by a cataract or to correct a refractive error of the lens. Pupil dilation is an essential prerequisite for these procedures and, if not maintained throughout the surgical procedure or if miosis occurs, the risk of injuring structures within the eye increases and the required operating time is often prolonged.|Submit

Jim Brennan|jimbrennan7@gmail.com|126 Silver Leaf Way|Castle Rock|CO|80108|303.717.2964|Have appointment with Dr. Conahan on Friday January 25 in Castle Rock.  Here is my history    Migraine-like Disorientation, mild dizziness, full-headedness, slight jaw tightening, slightly stiff neck, no acute headache, but usually feel like bad hangover. Symptoms seem worse at night starting at dusk. Some nystagmus in eyes, coupled with eye irritation at night.    Relief is provided by lying down or in recliner with head and neck support and not a lot of side-to-side movement.  Seems better while walking or moving entire body as opposed to sitting at desk, in meetings or watching TV. Lying on stomach with arched back feels better.  Applying slight pressure to head is somewhat comforting, coupled with head massage.  Had MRI in July--read by ENT, NeuroENT, Oncologist and Neurologist...results are negative.  Also have had Hearing Tests, Balance Tests, etc and passed these with no indications of Inner Ear as the issue.  Visited Opthamologist who felt that it was inner ear issue based on tracking eye movement that made me dizzy but NeuroENT could not find anything.  Vestibular PTs have variously described it as Mal de Debarquement and Cervicogenic Dizziness but therapy has not really worked here.  Neurologist did EEG--negative as well.  He put me on Topamax which I tried for 2 days and did not like feeling but maybe did not give it a chance.  Early treatments included Meclazine to treat dizziness and also Prednisone to clear Eustachian tube.  Recently tried acupuncture and will visit with TMJ Orthodontist to check for that. Have also tried Chiropractic specialists who noticed nystagmus. Xrays of spine are not ideal with some lower lumbar spondo and upper Cervical degeneration and forward head tilt.  No major or acute pain.  |Submit

My mother is 52. Hopefully in me telling you this, it will set the tone for our cry for help. I want to give you some background on my mother, in hopes that you will not simply disregard her story and our hope that someone will do for my mother, what they would do for their own.  Throughout my life, I have watched my mother work. One full-time job, two jobs at a time, go to night school to better herself and her chances at giving her children a better life. As a single parent, she never received any help from our father. She simply, kept going, refusing any public assistance, instead, working to make ends meet. My grandpa had Alzheimer’s and dementia, my grandma emphysema. My mother packed us up and relocated us from Arizona to Illinois to have them move in with us and take care of them. They lived with us until my grandpa was no longer safe in a normal home environment (Alzheimer’s) and my grandma passed, in-home. She is the most beautiful and hardworking self-sacrificing woman I have yet to meet in my 25 years. She is now currently taking care of my 31 year old mentally ill brother, who also lives with her. My whole life, I have watched her give up a ‘normal’ lifestyle, to take care of her family and their needs, before hers. My father passed away when I was 15 from a massive heart attack. Five years later, on my 20th birthday, I received word; my mother had suffered the same heart attack, but survived. She survived, only to be left now, wondering, is this it? Is this what I survived? “To live my life, slowly going blind, having to be fired from my job due to my eyesight.”   My mother has never been fired from any of her positions. And now, due to the fact, she is a contract employee without health insurance she cannot receive the help. It is not about the ability to repay a loan or payment plan, but the fact no one is even willing to work with her to help her regain her life. My mother moved to Colorado to be closer to me, her daughter, and to share her life with her family. I wanted to have memories of my mother and my son, things that I missed out on growing up. We aren’t asking for a handout but I guess in this day and age a miracle. A miracle that in hopes someone will go back to the way it used to be, good faith and a signature. A signature that states that the procedure, time, and money spent will be repaid. I will repay the procedure myself. My whole family will. But we do not have the money upfront that has been quoted at up to $10,000.00. Please help me help my mother. The way that she has helped so many others.   If you are still reading this, thank you for hearing my mother’s store and my plea that someone will even consider helping such a great woman.  If you have any suggestions or help to contact me with, please contact me immediately.  Regards,   Kacee Jo Lottman  720-620-2762 (Cell) / mskaceejo@gmail.com|Submit

I have attached my resume for your review.    I am currently a home based business owner, and stay-at-home mom to three children. I have established a successful online ebay and Amazon business with rising yearly sales and solid customer satisfaction. I have earned the ebay top rated seller/power seller status and work very hard to maintain the highest level of customer service that every buyer deserves.  Although this is a very exciting business venture, it just does not provide the consistent monthly income that our family requires.     Now that my children are all entering school, I am very motivated and excited to expand my life experiences and join a professional business team. I feel that I would be the best fit for your company because I am an independent, hard-working individual who is dedicated to providing quality customer service while managing multiple responsibilities in a fast paced environment. I possess the positive energy and desire to learn that you are looking for in a valuable team member.     I appreciate your time and consideration, and look forward to the opportunity to speak with you.    Sincerely,  Sarah Nesland|Submit

I know you probably get emails like this all the time, but please read this entire email as this really could help your business. I’m a marketing consultant in San Diego, Ca and I found your website on Google but noticed that for some of the major keyword phrases like \"Lasik Surgery\" which gets searched over 9,000 times a month in your city, you are NOT anywhere to be found. I wanted to offer to put your website on the first page of Google and you DO NOT HAVE TO PAY any monthly fees unless I can actually get you on the first page for your keywords.     I know this sounds crazy, but I am so good at Search Engine Optimization I can make a guarantee like this. If you want more business from your website, then we should talk. I can also show you some of my happy clients who dominate Google. My prices are very affordable and there is NO RISK on your part because if I FAIL to put you on the first page then you don’t pay any monthly fees, as I take on all the risk. I can get you ranked for whatever keywords you want! I am sending this email to 27 other Surgeons in the local area and the first one to take me up this offer gets it as I can only work with one type of business per city.

Beth Hemenway|hmhbah@comcast.net|9077 W. Plymouth Ave.|Littleton|CO|80128|3033585967|I really like Dr. Habhab and value her service.  I can\'t say so much for your billing and record keeping department, though.  I recently had an issue with an invoice.  In November I received an invoice for services in July and August for my daughter Heather.  I did not receive any notices until November and all of a sudden I was receiving invoices with threats to send my account to collections.  I called several times and was told that corrections would be made.  From what I can tell the error was from the insurance payment and how it was credited to the account.  I thought everything was taken care of.  Thursday evening I received another invoice for a $20 fitting fee for contacts and $30 fee for contacts that I ordered in December.  The contacts also came in the mail that night with a copy of my credit card receipt for $30.  Today I spoke with Lesley.  The $20 fee was paid and the $30 fee was paid but I couldn\'t get her to do any research.  I will pay the $20 fee again because I don\'t have time to go back 6 months to find a receipt for $20.  I\'m pretty sure I paid the $20 fee in July and paid in cash.  The $20 isn\'t a big deal, it\'s the fact that nothing else was done correctly so why should I be penalized because the record keeping department doesn\'t know what they are doing.  I\'m very unhappy with the way the records are kept and the way Lesley handled this.  I don\'t want to change eye doctors but also don\'t want to have to continue to argue about my invoices 6 months after the fact. Thanks!|Submit
